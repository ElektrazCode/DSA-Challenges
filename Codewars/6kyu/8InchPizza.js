/** DESCRIPTION:
How much bigger is a 16-inch pizza compared to an 8-inch pizza? A more pragmatic question is: How many 8-inch pizzas "fit" in a 16-incher?

The answer, as it turns out, is exactly four 8-inch pizzas. For sizes that don't correspond to a round number of 8-inchers, you must round the number of slices (one 8-inch pizza = 8 slices), e.g.:

how_many_pizzas(16) -> "pizzas: 4, slices: 0"
how_many_pizzas(12) -> "pizzas: 2, slices: 2"
how_many_pizzas(8) -> "pizzas: 1, slices: 0"
how_many_pizzas(6) -> "pizzas: 0, slices: 5"
how_many_pizzas(0) -> "pizzas: 0, slices: 0"*/
function howManyPizzas(n) {
    const pieces = ((n/2)**2)/16;
    return `pizzas: ${Math.floor(pieces)}, slices: ${Math.round((pieces%1)*8)}`;
  }
